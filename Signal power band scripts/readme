# Goals: 
  (prepareForAnalysis.m)
  1) Clean data sets prior to running analysis and define necessary params. This MUST be run prior to PB_A.m or PB_FF_A.m. 
  (PowerBand_Analysis.m)
  2) Apply stratify REST data into early and late (first five runs v. last five runs of overall therapy) then apply PCA and calculate mean centroids '
  3) Repeat for TASK data 
  4) Calculate change in mean centroid location for REST and TASK data for first and final five runs
  
  Note: Must define (cf, fwhm) for each frequency band EXCEPT feature frequencies. Due to pt-dependent (cf, fwhm) FF has its own script.
