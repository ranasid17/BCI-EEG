# Goals: 
  (prepareForAnalysis.m)
  1) Clean data sets prior to running analysis and define necessary params. This MUST be run prior to PB_A.m or PB_FF_A.m. 
  (PowerBand_Analysis.m)
  2) Apply stratify REST, TASK data into early and late (first five runs v. last five runs of overall therapy) then apply PCA and calculate mean centroids. 
  3) Calculate change in mean centroid location for REST and TASK data for first and final five runs. 
  4) Plot results.
  
  Note: Must define (cf, fwhm) for each frequency band EXCEPT feature frequencies. Due to pt-dependent (cf, fwhm) FF has its own script.
