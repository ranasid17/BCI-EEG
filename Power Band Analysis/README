# Goals: 
  1) PrepareForAnalysis.m: 
    ## Clean data sets prior to running analysis and define necessary params.
    ## This must be run prior to PowerBand_Analysis.m or PowerBand_FeatureFrequency_Analysis.m. 
  2) PowerBand_Analysis.m
    ## Stratifies REST, TASK data into early and late (first five runs v. last five runs of overall therapy
    ## Applies PCA to EEG recordings then calculates mean centroids in PC space. 
    ## Calculates change in mean centroid location for REST and TASK data for first and final five runs. 
    ## Plot results.
  
  Note: Must define (cf, fwhm) for each frequency band EXCEPT feature frequencies (which are pt specific) 
  Due to pt-dependent (cf, fwhm) FF has its own script.
