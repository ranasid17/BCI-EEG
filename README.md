# Signal-Band-Laterality
Composition: Merge 'createArrayForPCA', 'PCAFunction', 'centroidCalculation' 
Purpose: Run same processes from above scripts on Pts 1-10 for first and final 5 trials, constrict to respective frequency bands
Goal: Determine change in laterality of motor cortex activity after IpsiHand use
Output: 150x10 double arry of difference in Contralateral:Ipsilateral signal ratios from first to final 5 trials
