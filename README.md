# Signal-Band-Laterality
Scripts for signal laterality analysis
Power band analysis uses PCA analysis to plot average change in signal laterality for ipsilateral AND contralateral hemispheres
Signal laterality analysis uses ratio of ipsilateral:contralateral signal change across all trials to determine if effect is occurring  
GOAL (of all files): Determine change in laterality of motor cortex activity after Ipsihand use
