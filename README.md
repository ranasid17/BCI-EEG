# EEG-PCA
Research Goal: 
  1) Determine if there is hemisphere-dependent change in motor signal origin (measured by EEG) in patients who recover motor function through brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy. 

Functional Goals: 
  1) Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to EEG recordings of patients undergoing brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy in order to simplify variance structures to better detect and visualize underlying trends. 
  2) In the time domain, calculate median motor signal initialization and termination location for same cohort of patients before therapy initialization and after therapy conclusion, then test for mean localization change.  

Notes: 
  1) Power Band Analysis calculates average change in signal laterality origin for ipsilateral AND contralateral hemispheres independently in PC space.
  2) Signal Laterality Analysis uses ipsilateral:contralateral signal change across all trials to determine if there is an effect.
