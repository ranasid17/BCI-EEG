# EEG-PCA
Research Goal: Determine if there is hemisphere-dependent change in motor signal origin (measured by EEG) in patients who recover motor function through brain-computer interface (BCI) therapy. 

Functional Goal: Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to patient EEG recordings to conduct analysis in PC space (rather than time or frequency domains).


Power band analysis uses PCA analysis to plot average change in signal laterality for ipsilateral AND contralateral hemispheres
Signal laterality analysis uses ratio of ipsilateral:contralateral signal change across all trials to determine if effect is occurring  
GOAL (of all files): Determine change in laterality of motor cortex activity after Ipsihand use
